#Addition of 10+6
print(10+6)
#Subtraction of 10-6
print(6-3)
#Division of 10 by 6
print(10/6)
#Multiplication of 10 by 6
print(10*6)

#approach 2 - Let's optimize the code even further to make it simpler to change the values in the code above

#let 10 be "a" and 6 be "b"
a = 10
b = 6

#Addition of 10+6
print(a+b)
#Subtraction of 10-6
print(a-b)
#Division of 10 by 6
print(a/b)
#Multiplication of 10 by 6
print(a*b)
